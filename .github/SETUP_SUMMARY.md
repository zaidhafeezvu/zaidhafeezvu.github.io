# GitHub Actions Deployment Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Production Deployment Workflow** (`deploy.yml`)
- Triggers on push to `main` branch
- Uses latest Bun version for fastest builds
- Includes caching for `node_modules` and Bun cache
- Optimized build with code splitting:
  - **Vendor chunk**: React & React DOM (11.72 kB)
  - **Icons chunk**: Lucide React icons (15.18 kB)  
  - **Motion chunk**: Framer Motion (115.49 kB)
  - **Main chunk**: Application code (213.73 kB)
- Total build size: ~380 kB (compressed: ~115 kB)

### 2. **Continuous Integration Workflow** (`ci.yml`)
- Runs on pushes and pull requests
- Performs linting, type checking, and build verification
- Generates build size reports in workflow summaries
- Supports multiple Bun versions (currently using latest)

### 3. **Optimized Vite Configuration**
- Custom base URL for GitHub Pages
- Code splitting for optimal loading
- Asset optimization and chunking
- Production-ready build settings

### 4. **Custom Domain Support**
- CNAME file configured for `zaidcode.me`
- Proper DNS and GitHub Pages integration
- Automatic HTTPS certificate management

## 🚀 Deployment Process

1. **Push to main** → Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
2. **Create PR** → CI checks run automatically  
3. **Merge PR** → Production deployment updated

## 📋 Next Steps

### Required (for deployment to work):
1. **Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Set source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Save configuration

### Optional (for enhanced workflow):
2. **Configure branch protection**
   - Require PR reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass

## 🔧 Commands

```bash
# Development
bun run dev          # Start development server
bun run build        # Build for production
bun run preview      # Preview production build
bun run lint         # Run ESLint
bun run deploy       # Build and show deployment message

# Manual deployment
git push origin main # Triggers automatic deployment
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Build time**: ~5 seconds
- **Total size**: 380 kB (uncompressed)
- **Compressed size**: 115 kB (gzip)
- **Largest chunk**: Framer Motion (115 kB)
- **Core React**: 11.7 kB (vendor chunk)

## 🔍 Monitoring
- GitHub Actions tab for build status
- Repository Settings → Pages for deployment status
- Build size reports in CI workflow summaries
- Custom domain health at https://zaidcode.me

The deployment setup is complete and production-ready! 🎉
